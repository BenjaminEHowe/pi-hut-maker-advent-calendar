# The Pi Hut Maker Advent Calendar - Code

This repository contains code written while playing with my [Maker Advent Calendar from ThePiHut.com](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-advent-calendar-includes-raspberry-pi-pico-h). I'll be opening a drawer every other day (i.e. drawer 1 on 1st December, drawer 2 on 3rd December, etc.) to make it last until the big day. If you don't have a calendar but want to "follow along" then [the daily guides are available from The Pi Hut's website](https://thepihut.com/pages/advent).

At the risk of stating the obvious, the code is this repository will be pretty experimental and almost certainly won't follow best practices around testing etc.
